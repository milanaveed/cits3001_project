## Collaboration tips
I made some mistakes when using git before, so I feel it's instrumental to write them down and it'll serve as a reminder for us.
- Make sure you're in the desired branch before working by `git status` or having a look at your vscode bottom bar, the branch name should be displayed there
- Before working in your local folder, run the command `git pull origin main` to get your local files updated
- After working in your local folder, you can make commits in your vscode sidebar--git interface(recommended, it's easier to name for each small change) or in the integrated terminal. And then publish to Github by pressing the button "Sync xxx" in your vscode interface, or by `git push origin <your branch name>`
- I feel it's a better way to make pull requests on the Github page directly. Don't forget to add the other person in the project as a reviewer when creating a pull request

## Report
To demonstrate your understanding of your implementations you will be required to write a final project report. Your report must conform to the following guidelines
• At least 3 pages
• No longer than 5 pages
• No smaller than size 12 font
You are allowed to add appendices with extra figures and words but these may not be marked. Your report should cover the following areas:
### Analysis
• Analyze and contrast the performance of the chosen AI methods.
• Discuss their respective strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for playing Super Mario Bros.
### Performance Metrics
You will notice that gym-super-mario-bros reward function assumes the objective of the game is to move as far right as possible. You are encouraged to come up with other performance and evaluation metrics for your agents. Novel and interesting metrics that you come up with will be rewarded.
### Visualization and Debugging
Includewhatvisualizationtechniquesyouusedtogaininsightsintotheagent’sdecision- making process.
Include what debugging/profiling tools you utilised to optimize the algorithms and enhance performance.
