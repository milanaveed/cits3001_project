## Collaboration tips
I made some mistakes when using git before, so I feel it's instrumental to write them down and it'll serve as a reminder for us.
- Make sure you're in the desired branch before working by `git status` or having a look at your vscode bottom bar, the branch name should be displayed there
- Before working in your local folder, run the command `git pull origin main` to get your local files updated
- After working in your local folder, you can make commits in your vscode sidebar--git interface(recommended, it's easier to name for each small change) or in the integrated terminal. And then publish to Github by pressing the button "Sync xxx" in your vscode interface, or by `git push origin <your branch name>`
- I feel it's a better way to make pull requests on the Github page directly. Don't forget to add the other person in the project as a reviewer when creating a pull request
